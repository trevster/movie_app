The precision in the denunciation of The Boys is one of its strongest points since satire towards these characters is not new, but combining it with the theme of corporate America and wild capitalism gives it a clear differential touch.\r\n\r\nThe series is a total hit and is perfectly developed, to the point of making it impossible to miss because chapter by chapter the anguish increases. So if you have free time, I strongly recommend you to watch this satirical series.","created_at":"2019-08-21T04:30:47.612Z","id":"5d5cc8f7a3d02700140b4c3b","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:25.592Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d5cc8f7a3d02700140b4c3b"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":3}

The focus clearly is around them and what they're doing. \r\nSo it's definitely an Anti-Superhero show which look and topic reminds me of 'Watchmen' or some other more Noir candidates in this genre.\r\n\r\nThe whole series is explicit, which adds up really well. Without the violence and the handling with sexual situations the whole show wouldn't be that impressive and near to the reality. Not appropriate for younger viewers, if you ask me.","created_at":"2019-08-16T12:44:02.812Z","id":"5d56a5124bc38b3503266cfa","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:25.449Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d56a5124bc38b3503266cfa"},{"author":"josalarcon2","author_details":{"name":"","username":"josalarcon2","avatar_path":null,"rating":9.0},"content":"For me the whole series is a total and effective satire that lets us see what would become of the world if fiction becomes reality: heroes lose interest in saving the world (or take advantage of its status), are forced to do things that are not right, to follow the company's own interests and do not go out to end the crime if they are not followed by a camera that captures each of their movements, even though they are always transmitting that image of exemplary citizen when in fact they are greedy and treat their fans badly.\r\n\r\nIt's also chilling to know that people in power act as judges and executioners to decide what crimes are profitable and what millions of dollars they rent their superheroes to other cities so they can be safe. The precision in the denunciation of The Boys is one of its strongest points since satire towards these characters is not new, but combining it with the theme of corporate America and wild capitalism gives it a clear differential touch.\r\n\r\nThe series is a total hit and is perfectly developed, to the point of making it impossible to miss because chapter by chapter the anguish increases. So if you have free time, I strongly recommend you to watch this satirical series.","created_at":"2019-08-21T04:30:47.612Z","id":"5d5cc8f7a3d02700140b4c3b","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:58:25.592Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/5d5cc8f7a3d02700140b4c3b"}]
